# *Excel_DataAnalysis:*
  Repo for practicing data analysis with Microsoft Excel  
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
	+ Visualisation (Histograms, boxplots, leaf diagrams, crossplots, mosaic plots, etc.)
	+ Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, coefficients of variation)
* Linear Regression (rates of change, correlation coefficients, cross correlation, Q-Q, etc)
* Logistic regression

## Practice projects, using data from:
* Kaggle competitions _(https://www.kaggle.com/)_ .
	+ "Titanic Survival data set (.csv)" from *Titanic*: *Machine Learning from Disaster* _(https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)_
		+ The competition is for developing an algorithmic model that successfully predicts which passenger(s) were likely to survive the crash of the Titanic;
		+ Two datasets are given ("train.csv" and "test.csv").
		+ Use the "train.csv" to build a prediction model that is able to predict whether passengers in the "test.csv" dataset survived or not.
	+ *etc.*
